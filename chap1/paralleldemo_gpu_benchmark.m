%% Testing host/GPU bandwidth
% The first test estimates how quickly data can be sent to and
% read from the GPU.  Because the GPU is plugged into the PCI bus, this
% largely depends on how fast the PCI bus is and how many other things are
% using it.  However, there are also some overheads that are included in
% the measurements, particularly the function call overhead and the array
% allocation time.  Since these are present in any "real world" use of the
% GPU, it is reasonable to include these.
%
% In the following tests, memory is allocated and data is sent to the GPU
% using the <matlab:doc('gpuArray') |gpuArray|> function.  Memory is
% allocated and data is transferred back to host memory using 
% <matlab:doc('gpuArray/gather') |gather|>.
%
% Note that PCI express v2, as used in this test, has a theoretical
% bandwidth of 0.5GB/s per lane. For the 16-lane slots (PCIe2 x16) used by
% NVIDIA's compute cards this gives a theoretical 8GB/s.

%% Testing memory intensive operations
% Many operations do very little computation with each element of an array
% and are therefore dominated by the time taken to fetch the data from
% memory or to write it back.  Functions such as |ones|, |zeros|, |nan|,
% |true| only write their output, whereas functions like |transpose|,
% |tril| both read and write but do no computation.  Even simple operators
% like |plus|, |minus|, |mtimes| do so little computation per element that
% they are bound only by the memory access speed. 
%
% The function |plus| performs one memory read and one memory write for
% each floating point operation.  It should therefore be limited by memory
% access speed and provides a good indicator of the speed of a read+write
% operation.
